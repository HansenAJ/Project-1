# Project-1

Xeno-Assault is a browser based Sci-Fi trivia game.

Users will be given the number of characters in a Sci-Fi Movie Title and have to guess the name letter-by-letter.
If an appropriate letter is guessed it is displayed in it's proper place, making it easier to guess further letters.

If the entire name of the Movie is guessed the Space Marine's hold their ground and defeat the Aliens!

For each incorrect guess a Space Marine will run away.

If six Space Marines run away there aren't enough forces left to defend and the Aliens over the base!

Functionality:

  Keyboard : Use the on-screen keyboard to input the guessed character. Once a character has been selected it will then become un-selectable for the remainder of this round of play to prevent attempting the same character twice.
  
  New Game : This button starts a new round of play. A random Sci-Fi movie title is selected with an appropriate number of characters displaying near the top of the screen.
  
  Reset: This button resets the score of the game and returns it to it's base state.
